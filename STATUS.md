# Node BI Development Status

Last updated: 2026-09-11
Release: **MVP COMPLETE — 0.1.0, local single-user scope**

## Current milestone and last completed task

M16 release gate passed. Astra architecture revision and all mandatory M0–M16 milestones
are complete. Last work: application-service boundaries, revision-aware preview isolation,
source-delete/save concurrency, shared cold source loading, QA and clean-stack acceptance.

## Delivered functionality

Projects; Excel import/inspection; versioned workflow editor; reliable autosave/recovery;
Select, Rename, Filter (AND), Sort, Limit, safe Calculated Column, Group By, inner/left Join,
Union and Pivot. Table, KPI, Bar, Line, Area, Pie, Donut and Scatter use workflow-owned
semantic config. Multiple dashboards support widget add/remove, titles, visibility,
drag/resize, revision-checked saves and recovery after browser/server/database restart.

The Sol implementation and all ADR-001–ADR-049 dispositions are preserved in
docs/ASTRA_HANDOFF.md and docs/ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md. New decisions: ADR-050–ADR-060.

## Release evidence

* Backend: **208 passed**, three SQLite-only skips; PostgreSQL variants pass.
  Ruff lint/format and strict mypy pass (58 application files).
* Frontend: **20 tests**, ESLint, TypeScript, OpenAPI drift check and production build pass.
* Playwright: **8 scenarios pass together**, including clean-stack full restart.
* Canonical Sales Analysis is created and configured through the UI. Korea revenue = **500**;
  Bar/KPI, both widget moves, resize, persisted layout and full workflow restoration are verified.
* Fresh PostgreSQL/source volumes were created under a separate test Compose project;
  migrations, startup, health/readiness and restart acceptance pass. Existing data was not reset.
* Docker dependency check passes; openpyxl XML protection is enabled; npm production audit is clean.
* 50000-row benchmark: cold source ~2 s, warm source ~10 ms; restored dashboard ~1.4 s.
  Full evidence, scope and reproducible commands: docs/QA_REPORT.md.

## Known non-blocking limitations

No known open P0/P1 in the required MVP.

* P2: abrupt failure before failed-upload compensation is journaled can leave an orphan file;
  inspect metadata/storage before manual reconciliation. No automatic orphan deletion is enabled.
* P2: cache byte accounting excludes Python/engine overhead; this is not a multi-user load guarantee.
* P3: upstream TestClient/Vite deprecation notices; extended keyboard/accessibility polish remains.
* Explicit scope limits: Float64 arithmetic precision, single-key inner/left Join, 128 Pivot categories,
  2000 chart points; table/preview pagination is bounded. OR, advanced formulas, multiple chart series,
  duplication, undo/redo and other optional features remain deferred in TASKS.md.
* Session drafts survive navigation/reload but end when their browser tab is closed.

## Next task and blockers

No required MVP task or blocker remains. Further product work should be selected from the
documented optional/post-MVP backlog without automatically expanding scope.

## Resume and operating context

Main stack: http://localhost:3000; API http://localhost:8000/docs. Compose ports bind to loopback.
Checkpoint commits: accc239 baseline; e2987fb revision/M10; 47076ba early charts/dashboard;
576d64a M11; baf6a8f complete charts/dashboard and initial QA. The commit containing this snapshot is the final release checkpoint.
Backup: .backups/before-astra-migrations-20260910.sql (ignored); no reset performed.
Migrations 0002–0004 add workflow revision, file cleanup queue and dashboard revision.
Use 127.0.0.1 for local Python/PostgreSQL connections in this Windows environment.
PostgreSQL tests use isolated UUID schemas. Do not run them concurrently with restart acceptance
against the same database. See README.md and docs/QA_REPORT.md for exact commands.
